* 2D Diffusion Celullar Automata
The problem consists in simulating a 2D gas by using a square
lattice in which each cell has four velocity vectors that
transport the contents to the neighbors. Each cell may or may not
have a particle.
** Evolution rule
1) Each cell generates a random number between 1 and 0.
2) Independently they decide what to do with the velocity
   vectors depending on the result.
   + With probability $p_0$ it does nothing.
   + With probability $p$ it rotates 90°.
   + With probability $1-2p-p_0$ it rotates 180°.
   + With probability $p$ it rotates 270°.
3) Each cell transports their contents
** Continuous Limit
In the continous limit i.e. small time steps and small cell size the difussion equation is recovered
with difussion constant

$$D = \frac{p+p_0}{2\left(1-(p+p_0)\right)}$$
** Implementation
*** n and nnew arrays
We will use two copies of the arrays,  we will apply the evolution rule in nnew but the actual movement happens in n.
This is very similar to how LB methods work and will make their
transition to them easier.
*** Deciding Rotations
After sampling number between 0 and 1 we decide what to with the velocities using the
following rule:
let $\alpha$ be the result and suppose $p_0 \leq p$
+ if $0<\alpha < p_0$ do nothing.
+ if $p_0<\alpha < p+p_0$ rotate 90 .
+ if $p+p0<\alpha < 2p+p_0$ rotate 270° .
+ else rotate 180°
The rotations are first done on the nnew array
*** Moving Contents Around
Actual movement is done by using the updated values in nnew.
